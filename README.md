# Gopher-awesomeness

A collection of awesome stuff.

Enjoy :)

Caution:  these notes by no means are guaranteed to be revised and coherent to the original materials (in fact, you could tell this from my poor writing XD). The way I see it is when I were grilled in an interview, I would go back to this repo and hopefully find out why instead of flipping through thousands of pages of pedantic materials, use them at your own risk.

I also append a list of books/courses that I think worth reading/watching. A list of my rss subscription is under /Resources/

## Books/Documents

### Computer Science

#### Computer Science Fundamentals

> Structure and Implementation of Computer Programs by Erald Jay Sussman and Hal Abelson

An awesome book to start with on programming/general computer science. Also refer to [SICP in Python](http://composingprograms.com/) for a Python version and accompanying assignments/projects.

> An Operating Systems Vade Mecum by Raphael Finkel

Although this book was written almost 20 years ago, it only covered core OS concepts hence is not that "dated". If you are looking for a one-night-to-finish material on OS, this is the right one.

> The Mythical Man-Month by Fred Brooks

"Software Engineering 101". 

#### Programming and Toolchains

> The Linux Command Line by William E. Shotts, Jr.

A great material on getting started with working with Linux.

> How Linux Works: What Every Superuser Should Know by Brain Ward

A bit in-depth introduction to Linux/OS internals.

> The LaTeX Tutorial: A Primer by Indian TeX Group

A formal presentation on core TeX features. If you are looking for an introductory material on TeX, this is the one for you.

> A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Strousturp

Concise yet in-depth overview of C++(17 and even 20) features.

> [500 Lines or less](<https://github.com/aosabook/500lines>)

If you want to read some illustrative and inspiring (especially Python) codes, this is a good one.

> [LearnCpp.com](http://learncpp.com) by Alex

A comprehensive course on C++11/14 with quality exercises.

> The Python Tutorial/ The Python Reference by Guido van Rossum

THE authentic guide to Python programming. 

> Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho

Including advanced Python programming techniques, clear guide to Pythonic coding and design patterns.

> Effective C++/More Effective C++/Effective Modern C++ by Scott Meyers

As C++ being such a pain in the ass, this series introduces C++ programming tricks and pitfalls. Also refer to [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines).

> The CMake [Tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/)

A step-by-step guide for using CMake.

> [CppCoreGuidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines)

Best practice from pros.

>  C++ Templates: The Complete Guide by D. Vandevoorde and N.M. Josuttis

Magic behind C++ generic programming.

#### Computer Graphics and Computer Vision

> Fluid Simulation for Computer Graphics by Robert Bridson

"Fluid animation 101".

> Confluence of Computer Vision and Computer Graphics by Ales Leonardis et al.

Paper collections on CV/CG research in the beginning of 21st century. 

> The Art of 3D Computer Animation and Effects by Issaac Kerlow

Written by "dalao" (XD) from Disney introducing animation film industry and animation techniques. A supplementary material would be "Computer Animation: Algorithms & Techniques by Rich Parent" (but this book is a bit dated).

> Nonlinear Continuum Mechanics for Finite Element Analysis by Bonet and Wood

Deformable object, elastic material simulation.

> Foundations of Physically Based Modeling and Animation by Ronald House and John Keyser

"Physics modelling 101" (mass-spring systems, particle-based systems, deformable object simulations and all you need to know)

> The Art of Fluid Animation by Jos Stam

"Fluid animation 102"

> Real Time Collision Detection by Christer Ericson

Literally speaking, every popular game engine contains code snippets from this book.

#### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

> Reinforcement Learning by David Silver

Detailed notes and quality lecture videos with a plenty of examples and rigorous mathematical proofs.

> Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop

Recommending this book is a sort of cliche; however, I wish to remind you the exercises are not freakishly hard to solve as compared with its frequently mentioned counterpart -- The elements of statistical learning, a book written by J. Friedman, which is I believe written for statisticians not programmers. 


### Mathematics

#### Pure Mathematics

> Linear Algebra and Its Applications by Peter Lax

Getting through linear algebra, abstract algebra, numerical algebra, linear functional analysis ...and more in only one book.

> Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin

A comprehensive introduction to mathematical analysis.

> A First Look at Numerical Functional Analysis by Walter Sawyer

A neat (and thin) book on introduction to mathematical analysis and linear functional analysis.

> Princeton Lectures in Analysis I~IV by Elias Stein and Rami Shakarchi

Rank up to graduate level analysis through completing this book series :)

> Celestial Encounters: The Origins of Chaos and Stability by Florin Diacu and Phillip Holmes

An informal presentation on the Differential Dynamical Systems. You can also find a looooot of anecdotes of those lovely mathemagitians.

> Calculus on Manifolds by Michael Spivak

Awesome introductory material.

#### Applied Mathematics

> Numerical Solution of Time-Dependent Advection-Diffusion-Reaction Equations by Jan Verwer and Williem Hundsdorfer

A comprehensive book on the Method of Lines on parabolic PDEs.

> Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications by De Berg Mark et al.

A really nice textbook with examples on applications. You might have seen this being the textbook for several computational geometry courses, and there IS a reason for that :)

>  The Algebraic Eigenvalue Problem by James Wilkinson

A classical reference on numerical eigenvalue problems with plentiful examples.

> Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd

This book is derived from (an excellent course) [EE364](http://ee364a.stanford.edu) from Stanford.

> Computational Science and Engineering by Gilbert Strang

Modern computational mathematics for engineers. [MIT 18.086]( https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-086-mathematical-methods-for-engineers-ii-spring-2006/readings/ ) is also a great course on this topic.
